      <description>This project was part of an initiation to Kaggle datasets and competitions. The problem statement is to predict the housing prices from suburbs/towns in USA. The data is available in Kaggle itself. Techniques of data preprocessing is required and then to predict the house prices.
I have used multiple techniques such as XGBoost, Linear regression, Random Forest to determine the best fit for the project. Used choropleth also to determine the density of the US population.</description>

      <description>This data was collected from a kaggle competition hosted to classify and predict credit card defaulters. Data engineering and prediction was done to find the best fit in predicting which customer has defaulted. Models such as Catboost, Logistic Regression.
Work Done: Credit card fraudulent transactions were classified as (1) and non fraudulent as (0). The project in short consists of: from Exploratory data analysis to feature scaling, training models, final score.</description>

      <description>This project was completed during an internship with HDFC Bank, wherein the first part of the project required an overview of the performance of banks in terms of ATM-POS transactions in India. The data was scraped from Reserve bank Of India website; the following years were chosen (2018-2019). The focus area for the project was to understand how HDFC Bank could improve itâ€™s Point of Sales (POS) Machine customer retention and also their performance in comparison to private and government banks in India.</description>

      <description>Being a huge football(Soccer) fan, this was a keen interest area for me. This project was done using libraries such as scikit, math, matplotlib to a name a few
Scraped data from various websites using python and selenium-JSON and API files/databases Engineered features from the given database to find out the best performing teams in the division based on conversion rate,xG,xA, xGpg, head to head statistics Optimized Linear Regression by composite scoring to get the best model for expected goals per season /per match for a team.</description>

      <description>Used pandas datareader option to import Netflix stock data over the last ten years. Yahoo Api was used to obtain the dataset. The objective of the project was to understand how models such as LSTM/ ARIMAX/ Auto ARIMA works and thus to predict the stock prices for next 2 months and then compare with the actual prices in future. Libraries used Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, ARIMAX. Keras, Dense, Sequential models were used to predict the future prices Key metrics such as ADF, P-value was implemeted to test normality of data Data preprocessing was done using MinMaxScaler and then the data set was split into training and testing datasets LSTM was implemented and a comparison between actual prices and predicted prices was done.</description>

      <description>Work Done: Scraped data from yahoo website to get the three highest volumes in crypto currencies over the last ten years Libraries used: yfinance, pandas data-reader, matplotlib, mplfinance, seaborn, pandas Exploratory data analysis done to understand stock price movements, volume to get market signals Percentage changes of month on month stock price movements calculated and plotted using distribution plots Candle plot and tickers were charted for a period of three months for the three cryptos.</description>

      <title>Factor Analysis of BFI Dataset (Python)</title>

      <description>WORK DONE: Factor analysis is to understand the influences of latent variables(unobserved), you cant directly measure. These latent variables are believed to be driving observed variables. Two types of FA: Exploratory and Confirmatory Exploratory: there is no precise relationship b/w observed and latent variables Confirmatory: it is established^ Two ways to fit the model: Bayesian or by frequency based
TECHNIQUES APPLIED: Exploratory factor analysis is done using frequencies method Libraries used: factor_analyser, math, scikit_learn etc.</description>
